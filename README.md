mdn local library tutorial with own modifications
In order to use this app:
1. Copy or clone this repository to where yoy want.
2. Go to command line (you need to be in the folder where you copied this repository) and run npm install. This is needed in order to install needed packages to run the app.
3. There are many ways to run the app. This is done from commandline. I list each one and what they do:
  
      3.1 npm start  (this command runs the app without any debugging).
  
      3.2 npm run debugstart  (runs the app with debugging. debugging appears on commandline).
  
      3.3 npm run devstart  (runs the app with automatically restarting of server upon file change. Useful when coding. Otherwise not needed).
  
      3.4 npm run devdebugstart  (runs the app with automatically restarting of server upon file change with debugging. debugging appears on commandline. Useful when coding. Otherwise not needed).

After starting the app. Write localhost:3000 on your preferred browser's address bar.
